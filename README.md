This app was a long time wish of my girlfriend.\
üõí **Draggable Shopping** list with Firebase Realtime data synchronization.\
üçΩ **Cooky calendar**, to save the meals, we will cook in the future.\
For the calendar I did not use a library, built it myself, quite a nice, interesting task.\
üì≤ Used the Composition API to write and use a [Composition Function](https://github.com/LPF33/shoppy/blob/master/src/composables/useDetectSwipe.js) for detecting the Swipe-Direction to switch to the previous or next month.\
üé≤ Jambo-Component: Just a simple Counter for a board game, we play usually. I'm too lazy to always turn over the game tiles to count each turn. So this app makes my life easier.

Next steps:

- Testing
- Budget Component to track all expenses and get a chart bar for monthly expenses
